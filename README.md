# SDL2CV

## A game-like curriculum vitae

### Motivation

Lame videos, single-page CV, at least two page CV, lame video introducing something (myself, code, or just verification video), thousands of sites to manage the same information.

Now it's time for the comeback, my comeback: Do someone want to know something about me? Compile it!

It's been a long time coming and I hope this idea spreads everywhere.

### Resources

Cmake, SDL2, almost any OS, I dindn't try any legacy OS but take for granted this won't work unlsess *you can open a window*.

### Description

For the time being this may just compile and show nothing (or just a few things).
The idea is to get a graphical and interactive way to get an idea of who am I and what do I do.
